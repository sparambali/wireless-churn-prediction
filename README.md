# wireless-churn-prediction
The dataset I have chosen is wireless_churn.csv.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas-profiling to help identify key insights found in the dataset.
Created Learning Curves for both algorithms (Logical Regression and Na√Øve Bayes).
Created one Ensemble Voting Model, to predict the proper classification, which includes: Logistical Regression,Boosting Technique (Bagging).
Finally choosing the best algorithm.
